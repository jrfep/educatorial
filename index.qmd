I want to share my experience in education and teaching.

My education contributions have varied between my career stages. My education role at UNSW is limited, primarily by opportunity, as I am not directly involved in teaching undergraduates, but I make significant contributions to broad education objectives. 

At both UNSW and at the Non Government Organization Provita in Venezuela I have engaged in capacity building and training activities for the Red List of Ecosystem in Australia and internationally (e.g. Abu Dhabi). 

Prior to appointment to my research position at UNSW, I taught undergrad and postgrad courses at the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC). 

Here I will show a bit of my experience, resources and products related to these educational activities:

- Work experience at UNSW
- CodeRs, Stats Lunch and Hacky Hours at UNSW and Cape Town University
- Capacity building for Red List of Ecosystems around the world 
- Capacity building in Venezuela
- NeoMaps Field courses in Venezuela
