title: "Red List of Ecosystems workshops"
---

Between 2017 and the present, in my role as member of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Working Group I have contributed to deliver training workshops in four countries. I led one course in Venezuela (2018), co-led a training workshop in Paraguay (2017), and was instructor in workshops in Abu Dhabi and Guyana (2018), building capacity for future RLE assessment with the involvement of Government and Non-Government organisations. The Abu Dhabi environmental authority was inspired by this first combined workshop on Red List of Threatened Species and Ecosystems to adopt the IUCN RLE standard and prepare the first RLE assessment for the Arabian region, published in 2023.

After moving to Australia, I also participated in the workshop to conduct an RLE assessment of the Australian Alps in December 2019 and coauthored the resulting workshop report. Due to the Covid pandemic, I was unable to continue contributing directly to these capacity building exercises in Latin America and other regions of the world. But, I participated remotely in a inception workshop for the global assessment of mangrove ecosystems. My experience and advice and the development of software tools was instrumental in the discussion about delimitation of assessment units and strategies for data collection and indicator selection. The project is ongoing, with assessment of three regions of the world completed so far.
